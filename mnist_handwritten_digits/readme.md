# MNIST Dataset

## Introduction

The MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset is a widely used dataset for training and testing image processing systems. It consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9), split into a training set of 60,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images. Each image is 28x28 pixels in size.

## Description

The MNIST dataset includes:

- **Training Images:** 60,000 images of handwritten digits.
- **Training Labels:** Corresponding labels for the training images.
- **Test Images:** 10,000 images of handwritten digits.
- **Test Labels:** Corresponding labels for the test images.

Each image is grayscale and has been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.

## How to Use

First, load the dataset files:

```python
import numpy as np

train_val_images = 'train_images.npy' # Train 80%, Validation 20%
train_val_labels = 'train_labels.npy' # Train 80%, Validation 20%
test_images = 'test_images.npy'
test_labels = 'test_labels.npy'

train_val_images = np.load(train_val_images)
train_val_labels = np.load(train_val_labels)
```

Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets:

```python
# 90% of the training data for training, 10% for validation
train_images = train_val_images[:int(train_val_images.shape[0] * 0.9)]
train_labels = train_val_labels[:int(train_val_labels.shape[0] * 0.9)]

val_images = train_val_images[int(train_val_images.shape[0] * 0.9):]
val_labels = train_val_labels[int(train_val_labels.shape[0] * 0.9):]

test_images = np.load(test_images)
test_labels = np.load(test_labels)
```

Now, you can use these splits for your machine learning model training and evaluation.
